# Hand-Gesture-Virtual-Detection
The purpose of this project is to develop a web-based hand gesture–controlled virtual mouse that enables users to interact with a computer system without using physical input devices. The application uses MediaPipe hand landmark detection and a Python Flask backend to track real-time hand movements through a webcam.
